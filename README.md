# BODEM
Black-box Object Detection Explanation by Masking

In this repository, you can find information, results, and source codes of the BODEM explanatation method. The method and experiments are described and discussed in this paper: "Model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence for object detection in image data", [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17249](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17249).

<h2>Object detection datasets</h2>
<p>We trained the object detection models on three different datasets.</p>
<p>Link to the datasets:
<br>

- The YOLO model was trained on a user interface control detection dataset.
- The R-CNN model was trained on a airplane detection: [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbusgeo/airbus-aircrafts-sample-dataset)
- The SSD model was trained on a vehicle detection, which is a subset of COCO, containing four object classes, i.e. CAR, BUS, TRUCK, and MOTORCYCLE: [Link to the dataset](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48)</p>
